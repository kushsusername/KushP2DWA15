In regards to using things like bootstrap and jquery, you need to
document that in your README file. It is considered outside code,
and it is very important to acknowledge that (using uncredited code
could be an Academic Honesty Issue). Not really a problem here,
as it's fairly obvious and common codebases, but something to be
aware of (and a requirement of the README).
*Also your README lacks any description of the site, please take a
look at http://dwa15.com/Projects/README for more information.
*You've also got a few validation errors one about using the <icon>
tag within an <a> (I didn't know about that one) and lack of alt tags
for you images. Definitely run your sites through
https://validator.w3.org/ to find any errors.
*Lastly, on your site, try to make it a little more clear what the
purpose of the site is. I know that it's project one for DWA15, but it's
a pretty sparse heading there.
